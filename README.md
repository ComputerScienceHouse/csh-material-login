Clone this repo and make sure you have Node 5 installed and activated ([NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is highly recommended), then:

```
npm install
bower install
npm start
```

The project will be built and a BrowserSync-enabled page will open in your default web browser automatically. All source files can be found in the appropriately-named subdirectory under `./src`.
